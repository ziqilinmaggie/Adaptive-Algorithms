####Programming Langauge:
JAVA

####IDE

This project compared three different kinds of video streaming techniques: HTTP progressive download technique; Typical Daynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP(DASH); and DASH based on quality adaptation algorithm.
In the code, the int[] movie is the video streaming data, int[] ntw_speed is the network envirnment, int bps1, int bps2, int bps3 are the different bit rate of the video streaming, int avg_nspeed is the average network speed and the data structure of “ArrayList” is used to act as a buffer zone. 
We compared different straming techniques used in the each bit rate of the video, and runing in different average network speed to see these techniques' performance.
